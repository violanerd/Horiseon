# Code Refactor Starter Code

Project: Horiseon Code Refractoring

Description: 
    - Refractor HTML to include semantic elements 
    - Optimize CSS 
    - add accessibility attributes -> alt tags for images

On this project, I learned how to parse out different parts of a website, look for the containers that should be included semantically in the HTML and think of ways to optimize CSS styling to avoid redundancy. 

Challenges included figuring out how the CSS affected the HTML, specific best use scenarios for html elements - specifically div, article and section, troubleshooting connecting a local git repository to github and deploying git pages.
