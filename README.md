# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Project: Horiseon Code Refractoring
Take a current website deployment and refractor the code to meet accessibility standards and optimize for search engines. Work to consolidate CSS

On this project, I learned how to parse out different parts of a website, look for the containers that should be included semantically in the HTML and think of ways to optimize CSS styling to avoid redundancy. 

Challenges included figuring out how the CSS affected the HTML, specific best use scenarios for html elements - specifically div, article and section, troubleshooting connecting a local git repository to github and deploying git pages.
